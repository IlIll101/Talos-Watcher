# Talos-Watcher
A discord bot that displays the status of https://talos.stuy.edu/.

If you go to Stuyvesant, you probably know how Talos crashes a lot.
This discord bot tells you the status of Talos without you needing to check.

The bot pings Talos 10 times every 1 mins and evaluates the responses to those 10 pings.

This project is open to improvement (I have limited JS experience)

The bot is currently hosted on a aws ec2 server
